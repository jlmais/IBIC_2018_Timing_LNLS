\begin{abstract}
   The AMC FMC carrier (AFC) is a MicroTCA.4 AMC board which has a very flexible clock circuit that enables any clock source to be connected to any clock input, including telecom clock, FMC clocks, programmable VCXO oscillator and FPGA. This paper presents the use of the AFC board as an event receiver connected to the Sirius timing system to provide low jitter synchronized clocks and triggers for Sirius BPM electronics and other devices.
\end{abstract}


\section{introduction}
Sirius is a 4th  generation  synchrotron light source  based  on  a 5BA magnetic lattice, currently under construction in Brazil by LNLS~\cite{sirius_ipac16}. The machine, designed to achieve a beam emittance of \SI{0.25}{nm$\cdot$rad} and scheduled for commissioning at the end of 2018~\cite{rodrigues2016sirius}, consists of a 150 MeV Linac, a 150 MeV to 3 GeV booster and a 3 GeV storage ring with 518 meters circumference and storage ring with 20 straight sections. Both booster and storage ring RF frequency is \SI{499.658}{MHz} and the Linac will inject in single or multi-bunch mode at \SI{2}{Hz}.

Sirius timing system~\cite{timing_icalepcs15} is a star topology optical fiber network where an event generator (EVG) broadcasts event frames to the event receivers. An event frame decoded by an event receiver can generate clock and trigger signals synchronized to the Sirius RF frequency for the beam injection process and other subsystems such as electron BPMs. The system is composed of Ethernet-configured standalone modules developed by SINAP through a collaboration with LNLS and remotely controlled by an EPICS soft IOC designed by LNLS~\cite{sinap-timing-epics-ioc}.

The Sirius BPM and orbit feedback systems were developed as an open-source hardware platform~\cite{ebpm_icalepcs13} based on MicroTCA.4 crates, AMC and FMC modules, 1 Gigabit Ethernet and PCI Express connectivity. The digital back-end of these systems is the AMC FMC carrier (AFC)~\cite{afc-git}, a MicroTCA.4 AMC board partially based on Simple PCIe FMC carrier (SPEC)~\cite{spec} design. 

Thanks to the flexible clock circuits, trigger and clock distribution options and digital interfaces available in the AFC board and MicroTCA.4 platform, the same hardware platform made it possible to develop an AFC timing receiver board that provides triggers and synchronized clocks for Sirius BPM electronics and other devices. From now on, it shall be referred to as AFC timing. 

\section{hardware}
This section presents the AFC board focusing on timing applications and the interface boards FMC 5 POF and uTCA RTM 8 SFP+.

\subsection{AFC}

The AFC board was specified by LNLS and designed by WUT (Warsaw University of Technology) as a double-width AMC card with 2 fully populated high-pin count FMC mezzanine slots, option for 8 multigigabit links routed to the MicroTCA Rear Transition Module (uRTM) connector, 8 MicroTCA.4 M-LVDS triggers, connectivity to PCIe at Fat Pipe 1 (x4 link), redundant 1 Gb Ethernet ports, full hardware support for the White Rabbit timing system and provision for standalone operation. 

It has a Xilinx Artix-7 200T FFG1156 FPGA and the available clocking resources are: (\textit{I}) a clock switch (Analog Devices ADN4604) allowing routing of MicroTCA.4 low-jitter clocks to any of the FMC slots or AMC connector, (\textit{II}) a 10-280~MHz I$_{2}$C programmable VCXO oscillator (Silicon Labs Si571, 571BJC000121G), (\textit{III}) a 25~MHz VCTCXO (Mercury VM53S3-25.000) connected to a frequency synthesizer (Texas Instruments CDCM61004) fixed configured to 125~MHz, (\textit{IV}) a 20~MHz VCXO (IQD VCXO026156) and (\textit{V}) three DACs (Analog Devices AD5662) to control the oscillators. 

Once inside a MicroTCA crate, an AFC timing should output triggers and a low-jitter synchronized clock through the MicroTCA backplane to the other AFC boards running in the same crate. The low-jitter clock will be used as a reference clock from the ADCs of the BPM electronics.

\subsection{FMC 5 POF}

The FMC 5 POF \cite{fmc-pof-git} was designed to provide up to 5 plastic optical fiber (POF) IOs, where each POF slot can be manufactured as input or output. Sirius timing system will use these boards with 5 POF outputs to trigger near devices such as power supplies during the booster energy ramp.

\end{figure}

\subsection{uTCA RTM 8 SFP+}
The uTCA RTM 8 SFP+ \cite{rtm-sfp-git} is a Rear Transition Module board MicroTCA.4 standard. Its main components are 8 SFP+ connectors, which will provide optical fiber interface with timing system, and a general purpose 10-280~MHz I$_{2}$C programmable XO oscillator (Silicon Labs Si570, 570BCC000121G) to output a reference clock to the FPGA GTP transceivers.

\section{FPGA Gateware}

This section describes the main aspects of the FPGA gateware to implement an event receiver and a frequency and phase locked loop to output a low jitter synchronized reference clock to the ADCs of the BPM electronics.

\subsection{Event Receiver}

An event frame sent from the EVG consists of an 8-bit event code and an 8-bit distributed data bus (DBUS), where each bit of the DBUS maps a sinchronized clock generated by the EVG.
As the EVG is continuously sending event frames at the rate of the event clock, which is $\frac{1}{4}RF=124.9145~MHz$, the AFC timing can monitor a bit of the DBUS or an event code and then output a clock or a trigger, respectively. 

The AFC timing has 18 independently configurable channels, 10 POF outputs from 2 FMC 5 POF boards and 8 AMC configurable as input or output. An AMC channel operating as input can receive a general purpose trigger from another AFC board and, for example, send a corresponding event to the EVG. Once in trigger output mode, each one of these channels can adjust the pulse width and the delay between event receiving and output the trigger with a resolution of one event clock period ($\sim$8~ns), the number of pulses from 1 to 65535 and the pulse polarity level (low to high or high to low).  

\subsection{Frequency and Phase Locked Loop}
 A frequency and phase locked loop (Fig.~\ref{fig:AFCRefClockLoop}) was designed to generate a low-jitter synchronized reference clock to the ADCs of the BPM electronics using the VCXO Si571.
 
 and feedbacked to the FPGA by the ADN4604 clock switch.

From the event clock recovered by the FPGA GTP transceiver, a Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM) generates the reference clock and also the dmtd clock, which is used by the frequency and phase feedback controller to measure the phase difference between the reference and the output clocks. Defining, respectively, the event, reference, dmtd and output clocks as $f_{evt}$, $f_{ref}$, $f_{dmtd}$ and $f_{out}$, we have

\[f_{evt} = \frac{1}{4}RF \approx 124.915~MHz\]
\[f_{out} = f_{ref} = \frac{5}{36}RF \approx 69.397~MHz\]
\[f_{dmtd} = f_{ref}\frac{N}{N+1} \approx 68.918~MHz;~N=144\]

\begin{figure}[!htb]
   \centering
   \includegraphics*[width=0.9\columnwidth]{AFCRefClockLoop}
   \caption{Synchronized reference clock block diagram.}
   \label{fig:AFCRefClockLoop}
\end{figure}

The frequency and phase feedback controller (Fig.~\ref{fig:AFCFPGADMTD}) is characterized by a frequency detector (FD) and a phase detector (PD) running in two independent feedback loops at the same time.

The FD counts the rising edges of the two input clocks during a fixed time window and calculates the difference between them to output a value proportional to the average of $f_{ref}-f_{out}$ during the time window. The length of the time window determines the sample rate, which is also the resolution of the FD, configured to be 18 Hz. A proportional and integral controller closes the loop and tunes the VCXO frequency via the I$_{2}$C, an interface that allows adjusts up to $\pm3500~ppm$ from the center frequency configuration. 

The PD is a digital version of the Dual Mixer Time Difference (DMTD)~\cite{allan1975picosecond}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DigitalDMTD}, a linear method to measure the phase difference between two clock signals at the same, or quite same, frequency. It consists of two D flip-flops connected to the same clock source $f_{dmtd}$, which frequency is slightly lower than the one from the input clocks, undersampling $f_{ref}$ and $f_{out}$. The phase difference between the clocks on the flip-flop outputs is the same as the inputs, although the output frequencies are lower and equal to $f_{beat}=f_{ref}-f_{dmtd}$ and hence the time interval realtive to the phase difference is an integer number of $f_{dmtd}$ periods. Thus, a time counter running at $f_{dmtd}$ was used to output a value $n$ proportional to $\phi_{ref}-\phi_{out}$, which is the phase difference between $f_{ref}$ and $f_{out}$ given on the interval $[0,2\pi[$ radians. Regarding the time difference between $f_{ref}$ and $f_{out}$, the measurement resolution $\Delta t_{min}$ is

\[\Delta t_{min} = \frac{1}{f_{dmtd}}\frac{f_{beat}}{f_{ref}} = \frac{1}{Nf_{ref}} \approx 100~ps\]

\[f_{beat} = f_{ref}-f_{dmtd} = \frac{f_{dmtd}}{N} \approx 478.6~kHz\]

\[\phi_{ref}-\phi_{out} = \frac{2\pi n}{N};~n \in [0,N]\]

To close the phase feedback loop, a proportional controller uses the DAC AD5662 controlled by an SPI interface to tune the VCXO driven its control voltage input. This configuration allows a frequency adjust range of $\pm192~ppm$.

Once the both feedback loops are running, a large difference between $f_{ref}$ and $f_{out}$ turns the PD output negligible and the VCXO is driven by the frequency feedback loop, thereby moving $f_{ref}$ toward $f_{out}$. Thus, the FD output decreases gradually and the frequency feedback loop becomes inactive when $f_{ref}-f_{out}=0$. At the same time, the PD output becomes stable and the phase feedback loop output increases, turning the phase difference $\phi_{ref}-\phi_{out}$ constant. 

Capture range is the maximum value of ${\mid f_{ref}-f_{out} \mid}$

\section{Phase Noise Performance}

The Figure~\ref{fig:AFCPhaseNoise} shows the phase noise of the reference clock (trace~3) and the VCXO, while free-running (trace~2) and controlled (trace~1), characterized using a Rohde \& Schwarz FSUP signal source analyzer, as well as the respective integrated rms jitter (1 Hz-5 MHz). Taking the traces 2 and 3 is possible to see that the free-running VCXO is better than the reference clock at high frequencies and the traces are crossing about 200~Hz. The integrated rms jitter was about 78~ps and 25~ps, repectively. Hence, the cutoff frequency of the phase feedback loop should be 200~Hz, which was nearly achieved adjusting the moving average filter parameters and the proportional gain, as shown by the trace 1, resulting in an integrated rms jitter of about 4~ps.

\end{figure}

\section{Software Interface}
The AFC timing receiver will be interfaced with the control system by means of the HALCS framework ~\cite{halcs_pcapac16} ~\cite{halcs_icalepcs17}. It provides a modular approach for abstracting gateware modules as software services that can be exported to a control node and controlled through an RPC API. Because of that approach, all of the already supported gateware modules can be leveraged without extra effort, as the framework will automatically identify known modules and export its functionality.

On top of that, an EPICS IOC with an asyn-based driver was developed to interface with HALCS, mapping the exported RPC API to EPICS PVs and providing access to all of the AFC timing receiver gateware functionalities.
